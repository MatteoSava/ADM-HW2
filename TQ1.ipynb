For each integer value of k it returns the element at the \"k\"th integer position of sorted array A. Therefore by iterating k through the length of A we are performing the selection sort where after every step we get the elements of the sorted array in ascending order.So here in our algorithm if we are able to store the return value \"s\" into an array. After all the iterations of k we get a sorted array of A\n",
